            <h2>Notes on Analogy, Cognition, Artifical Intelligence, Semiotics</h2>
            <p>"Cognitive theories realized that metaphor is not an exceptional decorative occurrence in language, but is a main mechanism by which humans understand abstract concepts and carry out abstract reasoning (e.g. Lakoff and Johnson [22], Lakoff [21], Johnson [18]). On this view, metaphors are structure-preserving mappings (partial homomorphisms) between conceptual domains, rather than linguistic constructions."</p>

            <p>"The topic of analogy has a special place in the field of cognitive science. Modern cognitive science arose as a discipline in the final half-century of the millennium just ended-scarcely a tick on the clock of human life on earth. Although several converging factors led to the development of cognitive science, perhaps the most critical was an analogy-that between human information processing and the processing performed by the digital computer. This basic analogical insight, that cognition can be systematically analyzed as a form of computation, guided early work on such cognitive processes as memory, attention, perception, and problem-solving.</p>
            <p>Although an analogy provided a major part of the foundation of cognitive science at its inception, the study of analogy itself as a cognitive process did not receive much attention until somewhat later. Modern views of analogy can be traced to such pioneering influences as the philosopher Mary Hesse (1966), whose treatise on analogy in science argued that analogies are powerful forces in discovery and conceptual change. For some time, however, most research on analogy, both in artificial intelligence (Evans 1968) and in psychology (Piaget, Montangero, and Billeter 1977; Sternberg 1977) focused on four-term analogy problems of the sort used in intelligence tests (e.g., cat is to kitten as dog is to what?), rather than on the richer analogies used in science and everyday life."</p>
            
            
            <p>"About 1980, several research projects in artificial intelligence and psychology began to take a broader view of analogy. Researchers in artificial intelligence started to grapple with the use of complex analogies in reasoning and learning (Winston 1980; Schank 1982; Carbonell 1983, 1986; Hofstadter 1984). This exploration led to a more general focus on the role of experience in reasoning and the relationships among reasoning, learning, and memory, giving rise to an approach termed "case-based" reasoning (e.g., Kolodner 1993)."</p>

            <p>"Pellegrino and Glaser (1982) present supporting data on three types of analogies, geometric, numerical, and verbal. They note that the data that most clearly support their model are from geometric analogies. In contrast to numerical or verbal analogies, in geometric analogies, all the information necessary for solving the analogy must be physically present. The evidence from verbal analogies is less clear with respect to the details of the conceptually driven model, but fairly clearly supports the interactive version of this model. Pellegrino and Glaser offer two types of supporting data: an additive factors modeling of response time for systematically manipulated verbal analogies (Pellegrino & Ingram, 1977) and a protocol analysis of solving psychometric verbal analogies (Heller, 1979)."</p>
