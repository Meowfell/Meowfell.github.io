            <h2>Notes on Analogy, Cognition, Artifical Intelligence, Semiotics</h2>
            <p>"One should not think of analogy-making as a special variety of reasoning (as in the dull and uninspiring phrase “analogical reasoning and problem-solving,” a long-standing cliché in the cognitive-science world), for that is to do analogy a terrible disservice. After all, reasoning and problem-solving have (at least I dearly hope!) been at long last recognized as lying far indeed from the core of human thought. If analogy were merely a special variety of something that in itself lies way out on the peripheries, then it would be but an itty- bitty blip in the broad blue sky of cognition. To me, however, analogy is anything but a bitty blip — rather, it’s the very blue that fills the whole sky of cognition — analogy is everything, or very nearly so, in my view.</p>

            <p>"Cognitive theories realized that metaphor is not an exceptional decorative occurrence in language, but is a main mechanism by which humans understand abstract concepts and carry out abstract reasoning (e.g. Lakoff and Johnson [22], Lakoff [21], Johnson [18]). On this view, metaphors are structure-preserving mappings (partial homomorphisms) between conceptual domains, rather than linguistic constructions."</p>

            <p>"The topic of analogy has a special place in the field of cognitive science. Modern cognitive science arose as a discipline in the final half-century of the millennium just ended-scarcely a tick on the clock of human life on earth. Although several converging factors led to the development of cognitive science, perhaps the most critical was an analogy-that between human information processing and the processing performed by the digital computer. This basic analogical insight, that cognition can be systematically analyzed as a form of computation, guided early work on such cognitive processes as memory, attention, perception, and problem-solving.</p>
            <p>Although an analogy provided a major part of the foundation of cognitive science at its inception, the study of analogy itself as a cognitive process did not receive much attention until somewhat later. Modern views of analogy can be traced to such pioneering influences as the philosopher Mary Hesse (1966), whose treatise on analogy in science argued that analogies are powerful forces in discovery and conceptual change. For some time, however, most research on analogy, both in artificial intelligence (Evans 1968) and in psychology (Piaget, Montangero, and Billeter 1977; Sternberg 1977) focused on four-term analogy problems of the sort used in intelligence tests (e.g., cat is to kitten as dog is to what?), rather than on the richer analogies used in science and everyday life."</p>
            
            
            <p>"About 1980, several research projects in artificial intelligence and psychology began to take a broader view of analogy. Researchers in artificial intelligence started to grapple with the use of complex analogies in reasoning and learning (Winston 1980; Schank 1982; Carbonell 1983, 1986; Hofstadter 1984). This exploration led to a more general focus on the role of experience in reasoning and the relationships among reasoning, learning, and memory, giving rise to an approach termed "case-based" reasoning (e.g., Kolodner 1993)."</p>

            <p>"Pellegrino and Glaser (1982) present supporting data on three types of analogies, geometric, numerical, and verbal. They note that the data that most clearly support their model are from geometric analogies. In contrast to numerical or verbal analogies, in geometric analogies, all the information necessary for solving the analogy must be physically present. The evidence from verbal analogies is less clear with respect to the details of the conceptually driven model, but fairly clearly supports the interactive version of this model. Pellegrino and Glaser offer two types of supporting data: an additive factors modeling of response time for systematically manipulated verbal analogies (Pellegrino & Ingram, 1977) and a protocol analysis of solving psychometric verbal analogies (Heller, 1979)."</p>

            <p></p>"Ryan Johansson’s idea [17] that metaphors provide a kind of software for the human mind by offering suggestions or commands to attempt to consistently relate two systems and thus force the mind to construct understanding by trying to resolve ambiguities and contradictions of the resulting mapping."</p>

            <p></p>"Mentally, analogical and categorical connections between concepts are the same kind of connection. They differ in the degree to which they are entrenched in our general conceptual systems and in that part of our conceptual system I am calling our category structures. Certain connections are very deeply entrenched in our conceptual systems. We consider them to be category connections, and they seem uncreative to us. Recognizing a connection between one zebra and another zebra, or between two red things, might have been, at one time, highly creative, but no longer. Very many things "downstream" in our conceptual systems depend upon these connections. Yanking them from our conceptual systems would rip out massive dependent domains. They have a high degree of generative entrenchment; they have a high degree of cognitive indispensability."</p>

            <p>"Saussure defined the linguistic sign as a two-sided entity, a dyad. One side of the sign was what he called the signifier. A signifier is the thoroughly material aspect of a sign: if one feels one's vocal cords when speaking, it is clear that sounds are made from vibrations (which are undoubtedly material in nature). Saussure described the verbal signifier as a "sound image"."</p>

            <p>"Low-level perception is far from uninteresting, but it is high-level perception that is most relevant to the central problems of cognition. The study of high-level perception leads us directly to the problem of mental representation. Representations are the fruits of perception. In order for raw data to be shaped into a coherent whole, they must go through a process of filtering and organization, yielding a structured representation that can be used by the mind for any number of purposes."</p>

With development, the relational similarity system becomes differentiated into distinct and interrelated kinds of similarity based on dimensions such as part identify, color, and size, the relations of greater-than, less-than, and so on."</p>

            <p>"No one knows where the borderline between non-intelligent behavior and intelligent behavior lies, in fact, to suggest that a sharp border exists is probably silly. But essential abilities for intelligence are certainly:

(1) to respond to situations very flexibly;
(2) to take advantage of fortuitous circumstances;
(3) to make sense out of ambiguous or contradictory messages;
(4) to recognise the relative importance of different elements of a situation;
(5) to find similarities between situations despite differences which may separate them;
(6) to draw distinctions between situations despite similarities which may link them;
(7) to synthesize new concepts by taking old concepts and putting them together in new ways;
(8) to come up with ideas which are novel.”</p>
