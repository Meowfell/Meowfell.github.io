            <p>"One should not think of analogy-making as a special variety of reasoning (as in the dull and uninspiring phrase “analogical reasoning and problem-solving,” a long-standing cliché in the cognitive-science world), for that is to do analogy a terrible disservice. After all, reasoning and problem-solving have (at least I dearly hope!) been at long last recognized as lying far indeed from the core of human thought. If analogy were merely a special variety of something that in itself lies way out on the peripheries, then it would be but an itty- bitty blip in the broad blue sky of cognition. To me, however, analogy is anything but a bitty blip — rather, it’s the very blue that fills the whole sky of cognition — analogy is everything, or very nearly so, in my view."</p>

            <p>"Cognitive theories realized that metaphor is not an exceptional decorative occurrence in language, but is a main mechanism by which humans understand abstract concepts and carry out abstract reasoning (e.g. Lakoff and Johnson [22], Lakoff [21], Johnson [18]). On this view, metaphors are structure-preserving mappings (partial homomorphisms) between conceptual domains, rather than linguistic constructions."</p>

            <p>"The topic of analogy has a special place in the field of cognitive science. Modern cognitive science arose as a discipline in the final half-century of the millennium just ended-scarcely a tick on the clock of human life on earth. Although several converging factors led to the development of cognitive science, perhaps the most critical was an analogy-that between human information processing and the processing performed by the digital computer. This basic analogical insight, that cognition can be systematically analyzed as a form of computation, guided early work on such cognitive processes as memory, attention, perception, and problem-solving.</p>
            <p>Although an analogy provided a major part of the foundation of cognitive science at its inception, the study of analogy itself as a cognitive process did not receive much attention until somewhat later. Modern views of analogy can be traced to such pioneering influences as the philosopher Mary Hesse (1966), whose treatise on analogy in science argued that analogies are powerful forces in discovery and conceptual change. For some time, however, most research on analogy, both in artificial intelligence (Evans 1968) and in psychology (Piaget, Montangero, and Billeter 1977; Sternberg 1977) focused on four-term analogy problems of the sort used in intelligence tests (e.g., cat is to kitten as dog is to what?), rather than on the richer analogies used in science and everyday life."</p>

            <p>"About 1980, several research projects in artificial intelligence and psychology began to take a broader view of analogy. Researchers in artificial intelligence started to grapple with the use of complex analogies in reasoning and learning (Winston 1980; Schank 1982; Carbonell 1983, 1986; Hofstadter 1984). This exploration led to a more general focus on the role of experience in reasoning and the relationships among reasoning, learning, and memory, giving rise to an approach termed "case-based" reasoning (e.g., Kolodner 1993)."</p>

            <p>"Pellegrino and Glaser (1982) present supporting data on three types of analogies, geometric, numerical, and verbal. They note that the data that most clearly support their model are from geometric analogies. In contrast to numerical or verbal analogies, in geometric analogies, all the information necessary for solving the analogy must be physically present. The evidence from verbal analogies is less clear with respect to the details of the conceptually driven model, but fairly clearly supports the interactive version of this model. Pellegrino and Glaser offer two types of supporting data: an additive factors modeling of response time for systematically manipulated verbal analogies (Pellegrino & Ingram, 1977) and a protocol analysis of solving psychometric verbal analogies (Heller, 1979)."</p>

            <p>"Ryan Johansson’s idea [17] that metaphors provide a kind of software for the human mind by offering suggestions or commands to attempt to consistently relate two systems and thus force the mind to construct understanding by trying to resolve ambiguities and contradictions of the resulting mapping."</p>

            <p>"Mentally, analogical and categorical connections between concepts are the same kind of connection. They differ in the degree to which they are entrenched in our general conceptual systems and in that part of our conceptual system I am calling our category structures. Certain connections are very deeply entrenched in our conceptual systems. We consider them to be category connections, and they seem uncreative to us. Recognizing a connection between one zebra and another zebra, or between two red things, might have been, at one time, highly creative, but no longer. Very many things "downstream" in our conceptual systems depend upon these connections. Yanking them from our conceptual systems would rip out massive dependent domains. They have a high degree of generative entrenchment; they have a high degree of cognitive indispensability."</p>

            <p>"Saussure defined the linguistic sign as a two-sided entity, a dyad. One side of the sign was what he called the signifier. A signifier is the thoroughly material aspect of a sign: if one feels one's vocal cords when speaking, it is clear that sounds are made from vibrations (which are undoubtedly material in nature). Saussure described the verbal signifier as a "sound image"."</p>

            <p>"Low-level perception is far from uninteresting, but it is high-level perception that is most relevant to the central problems of cognition. The study of high-level perception leads us directly to the problem of mental representation. Representations are the fruits of perception. In order for raw data to be shaped into a coherent whole, they must go through a process of filtering and organization, yielding a structured representation that can be used by the mind for any number of purposes."</p>

            <p>"Early in development children understand the similarities in the way objects look only in terms of global, syncretic resemblances. With development, the relational similarity system becomes differentiated into distinct and interrelated kinds of similarity based on dimensions such as part identify, color, and size, the relations of greater-than, less-than, and so on."</p>

            <p>"No one knows where the borderline between non-intelligent behavior and intelligent behavior lies, in fact, to suggest that a sharp border exists is probably silly. But essential abilities for intelligence are certainly:

            (1) to respond to situations very flexibly;
            (2) to take advantage of fortuitous circumstances;
            (3) to make sense out of ambiguous or contradictory messages;
            (4) to recognize the relative importance of different elements of a situation;
            (5) to find similarities between situations despite differences which may separate them;
            (6) to draw distinctions between situations despite similarities which may link them;
            (7) to synthesize new concepts by taking old concepts and putting them together in new ways;
            (8) to come up with ideas which are novel.”</p>

            <p>"I have the notions that theological discourse is dominantly analogical, and that it often presents analogies as identities. So if I encounter "God is light," my notions about the domain of the discourse influence my expectations, and allow me to recognize this as an analogy, an identity, or, what is unusual, both simultaneously"</p>

            <p>"Relational morphisms can be considered as analogies between formal models affording understanding [25,29]. This formal treatment is related to S. Ryan Jo- hansson’s idea [17] that metaphors provide a kind of software for the human mind by offering suggestions or commands to attempt to consistently relate two systems and thus force the mind to construct understanding by trying to re-solve ambiguities and contradictions of the resulting mapping"</p>

            <p>"I'm going to suggest to you today that there's an alternative viewpoint, and I think it's one that, although you may be hearing about it formally for the first time, is also something that you know unbelievably deeply. Thousands of years ago, Plato proposed that all knowledge was remembering. Of course, we don't believe that today because we believe we gather knowledge as a consequence of contact with the world. But you'll see today that the knowledge I'm going to share with you will strike a deep chord of remembering, and it's because everything that you've done throughout your life is in one way or another predicated on what I'm going to tell you today.</p>
            <p>I'm going to demonstrate this in a peculiar way, I think, because I'm going to start by telling you a story. The reason I'm going to do that is because models of the world that include phenomena like consciousness, emotions, motivations, actions, and interactions are generally portrayed formally in stories and not in scientific theories. It turns out that stories themselves have an identifiable structure, even a grammar that makes them comprehensible. Furthermore, it turns out that even the simplest stories, especially if they're elegantly constructed, have an unbelievably profound underlying meaning, and you can frequently see this most particularly in children's stories.</p>
            <p>I remember I showed my son, when he was four years old, the Disney movie Pinocchio, which on the surface is a very strange tale. It's about a wooden puppet who wants to become real, so he has to rescue his father from the belly of a whale—a structure that could by no means be considered rational. It is, in fact, so surprising and unexpected that it's remarkable to imagine that grown men and women, including children, can sit in a movie theater and watch a story like that unfold without ever thinking for a second that it's absolutely peculiar. They can be taken in by such a tale and regard it experientially as real.
            Pinocchio is a deep, deep story. It has echoes that go back three or four thousand years to the earliest stories that we know, and it's so rich with information that a child can watch it over and over and over. I think my son watched Pinocchio thirty times. Why? Well, it's either because a child can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality, or it's because there's something to those stories that's much more potent than we actually consciously understand.</p>
            <p>It's kind of interesting, too. If you go to a video rental establishment, you'll find that in the top ten highest-grossing movies of all time are four Disney movies that are animated fairy tales, essentially retellings of mythological stories. They strike a deep chord. Why? Shakespeare, who was of course a great literary figure, said it perhaps better than anyone else has, which is not surprising because he said many things better than anyone else has. He said, "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances, and one man in his time plays many parts."</p>
            <p>Following from that, you can imagine that a story is no more about the props in the world than a play that you go see is about the props on the stage. A drama is about the manner in which people actually exist, the emotions that they feel, the motivational states they encounter, the problems they have to solve when they interact with each other. And the play's the thing from that particular perspective in which we can capture those aspects of our experience that are not only real but essentially human."</p>

            <p>"John-Steiner (1985) has collected anecdotes documenting the role that analogical reasoning plays in mathematical discoveries as well as in empirical disciplines like physics and psychology. Vosniadou and Ortony (1989, p. 1) suggest that analogy is "one of the most fundamental aspects of human cognition" playing a central role in classification, learning, scientific discovery, and creativity. For example, Clement (1986) showed that experts in technical fields spontaneously generated "bridging" analogies while solving novel physics problems posed by the experimenter. Clement also identifies similar uses of bridging
            analogies in the work of Galileo and Newton and argues for their importance in science education. The ability to go beyond superficial similarities and to recognize deeper analogies between problems is the hallmark of expertise and is one of the most important differences between novices and experts in any field (Faries & Reiser, 1988)."</p>

            <p>"Peirce spent the rest of his life elaborating a triadic theory of the sign. Representamen (the sign itself), object (what the sign signals), and the intepretant."</p>
