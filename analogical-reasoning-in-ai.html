            <h2>Analogical Reasoning in AI</h2>
            <p>"Cognitive theories realized that metaphor is not an exceptional decorative occurrence in language, but is a main mechanism by which humans understand abstract concepts and carry out abstract reasoning (e.g. Lakoff and Johnson [22], Lakoff [21], Johnson [18]). On this view, metaphors are structure-preserving mappings (partial homomorphisms) between conceptual domains, rather than linguistic constructions."</p>

            <p>"Ryan Johansson’s idea [17] that metaphors provide a kind of software for the human mind by offering suggestions or commands to attempt to consistently relate two systems and thus force the mind to construct understanding by trying to resolve ambiguities and contradictions of the resulting mapping."</p>

            <p>"No one knows where the borderline between non-intelligent behavior and intelligent behavior lies, in fact, to suggest that a sharp border exists is probably silly. But essential abilities for intelligence are certainly:
            (1) to respond to situations very flexibly;
            (2) to take advantage of fortuitous circumstances;
            (3) to make sense out of ambiguous or contradictory messages;
            (4) to recognize the relative importance of different elements of a situation;
            (5) to find similarities between situations despite differences which may separate them;
            (6) to draw distinctions between situations despite similarities which may link them;
            (7) to synthesize new concepts by taking old concepts and putting them together in new ways;
            (8) to come up with ideas which are novel."

            <p>"According to Veale (1995), in ideal metaphor generation we must ensure that source and target domains of the metaphor remain distinct. Therefore the structure of the target domain must not be transferred indiscriminately to the source domain. In Veale’s approach, two different structures (metaphor and simile) are used in parallel in order to generate metaphors. Whereas a simile explicitly sets forth properties of a source domain that apply to a target domain, the metaphors allow the indirect transfer of structural relations. Veale (1995) describes the computational realization of his theory and provides evidence for its psychological plausibility."</p>
