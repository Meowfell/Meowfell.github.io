            <h2>Semiotics</h2>
            <p>"The field of semiotics, often called semiology, is the study of signs and symbols as elements of communicative behavior. It explores how meaning is constructed and understood. The term was coined by the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, one of the founding fathers of semiotics."</p>

            <p>"Saussureâ€™s model of the linguistic sign is dyadic, comprising two sides. One side of the sign is the physical form of the sign itself, whether it is a sound, a word, or a photograph. Saussure called this side the signifier. The other side of the sign is the meaning or the concept that the signifier stands for. This, Saussure called the signified. The signifier and signified together constitute the linguistic sign."</p>

            <p>"In his Course in General Linguistics, Saussure noted that languages are systems of signs, and semiology is a science that studies the life of signs within society. The role of the signifier is to signal the concept, while the signified is the concept itself. Saussure's model emphasizes the arbitrariness of the relationship between the signifier and the signified. This relationship is based on social conventions, not natural connections."</p>

            <p>"Peirce identified three types of signs: icons, indices, and symbols. Icons are signs that resemble their objects, like photographs or diagrams. Indices have a direct connection to their objects, such as smoke indicating fire. Symbols, like words or flags, have a conventional relationship with their objects, which must be learned."</p>
